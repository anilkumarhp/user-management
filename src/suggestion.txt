
Here are a few suggestions:

    Detailed Profile Management for All Users:
        Endpoints for users (PATIENT, DOCTOR, NURSE, etc.) to view and update their own profiles beyond the basic information. This could include address, phone number, and other role-specific details.

    Enhanced Hospital Admin - Staff Management:
        APIs for Hospital Admins to update more details of their staff (not just status), including employeeId, department, or even reassigning roles like promoting a NURSE to a specific STAFF type within the hospital context.
        Potentially an API to remove/archive staff members.

    Patient-Specific APIs (interacting with other future microservices):
        Though the other services aren't built, we could stub out APIs like a patient viewing their appointments or lab results, which would involve authentication and then (conceptually) calling another service. This helps define the user-facing contract.

    Initial Setup for Pharma/Lab Admin Roles:
        Similar to Hospital Admins, these roles would eventually need to manage users or data specific to their organizations. We could start with their registration and basic login.
